# DATA1200-WebExam
Web development project for DATA1200 at OsloMet, specifically targeting Pilestredet 35. The project includes pages on accessibility, current topics, and campus highlights.

## Project Description
This group project is designed to showcase the OsloMet Campus, with a special focus on Pilestredet 35. The website consists of several pages that provide users with information on different aspects of the campus environment.

## Group Members
- Hadil Alshihabi - Led the development of the homepage and 'contact-us' page, structured the project, sought solutions for accessibility testing, and authored this README document.
- Badr-Unnisa Bibi - Managed the design and content for campus locations and media integration.
- Joulia Soussi - Was responsible for the 'topical' page content and code commenting.
- Bayan Zakariya - Focused on accessibility testing and crafting the accessibility page.

Each member has brought their specialized skills to the project, collaborating to ensure every aspect of the website meets the high standards we set for this assignment. Our combined efforts have resulted in a website that is not only informative and visually appealing but also accessible and user-friendly for all visitors.

## Technical Specifications
The website is built with HTML5 and CSS3. We strictly followed the project guidelines by not using JavaScript or other libraries, ensuring that all functionalities are compatible with the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications.

## File Structure
The project folder is organized as follows:

- `css/` - Contains all the style sheets for the website.
  - `location.css` - Styles for the page that covers Pilestredet 35.

- `html/` - Contains the HTML files for the website's content.
  - `accessibility.html` - Discusses the accessibility features and tests performed for the website.
  - `contact-us.html` - Provides a contact form or information for users wishing to contact campus officials.
  - `location.html` - Dedicated to showcasing Pilestredet 35 with images and information.
  - `topical.html` - Contains a current essay or information related to OsloMet Campus.

- `Images/` - A library to store all the images used on the website to enhance visual appeal and information dissemination.

- `index.html` - The main page that provides a general introduction to OsloMet Campus, with at least one relevant image to engage users.

- `README.md` - The file you are currently reading, which provides an overview and guidance for this project.

- `style.css` - General styles used across the entire website.

## Design Choices
The consistent visual design of the website promotes a seamless user experience. We have chosen to let the `location.html` page have a unique design to highlight its unique content.

## Accessibility
Our commitment to accessibility is a key aspect of our project. We faced challenges in testing the accessibility of our site initially due to local hosting limitations. To overcome this, we utilized Netlify to deploy our site publicly, which then allowed us to perform comprehensive accessibility tests. The deployed site can be found at [Netlify Team Overview](https://app.netlify.com/teams/haddelschool/overview).

Once the site was accessible online, we were able to use tools like [WAVE by WebAIM](https://wave.webaim.org/) to automatically evaluate the accessibility of our web content. We also leveraged Google's accessibility test tools and [Validator.nu](https://validator.nu/) to further ensure our site met web accessibility standards. These tools helped us identify and rectify issues, leading to a more inclusive user experience. Our proactive approach to addressing accessibility demonstrates our commitment to universal design and enhances the usability of our site for all individuals, including those with disabilities.

The insights gained from these tests were invaluable and guided us in making informed coding decisions to enhance accessibility. We made several adjustments based on the feedback provided by these automated tests, but we also made additional enhancements that go beyond automated detection to ensure our website is usable by as many people as possible.

## Running the Project
To view the website, clone the repository to your local machine and open `index.html` in a browser. Alternatively, access the website through the provided GitHub Pages link.
