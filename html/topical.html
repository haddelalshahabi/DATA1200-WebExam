                        <h1>Mobile Phones: Technical and Social Dimensions</h1>
                        <p>In the video, Hanne Cecilie discusses how a mobile phone can be understood as a technical device, a social device, and a phenomenon that reveals societal values. How can a mobile phone be interpreted through the lens of your field of study, and what do you think are its social implications? Personally, we've noticed that mobile phones have become a significant part of our lives and society. Although we don't use mobile phones extensively in our studies, they still play a vital role in our student life. In our field, mobile phones can be used for learning, such as downloading apps that help in learning programming languages, etc. However, we believe that mobile phones can be a major distraction across all fields of study.

                        <h1>Educational Utility and Distraction of Mobile Phones</h1>
                        <p>They are a distraction because they have social media and other apps that can reduce focus when you receive a message. On the other hand, there are also advantages. For example, the 'Studentkortet' app offers students discounts on food, coffee, clothes, and many other benefits. Additionally, it's possible to buy tickets cheaper and more efficiently digitally via various transit apps. Mobile phones and screens tend to isolate us, as many people prefer to sit in front of a computer screen rather than physically attending school. For instance, in discrete mathematics classes, the number of students attending via Zoom exceeds those present at school, even though many believe that physical learning is more effective.

                        <p>Think about the development of technology relevant to your field of study. For health science, it could be biotechnology; for computer engineering, it might be an application of machine learning; and for teaching, it could be digital technology used in the classroom. Is the development of this technology connected to a change in societal values? How? Do you approve of this change, or do you have concerns? Life is constantly evolving with new challenges and the need for development. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, schools closed, leading to the start of remote learning. This shift brought about significant digital advancement in society, altering some old values.

                        <h1>Remote Learning: Advantages and Challenges</h1>
                        <p>But how is technology tied to these changes in societal values? Are there advantages or disadvantages to these changes? School values have changed significantly recently. Students have lost their old routines and struggle to prepare for school. They wake up about five minutes before class starts, open their laptops, and log into Zoom. This leads to less physical activity compared to when attending school in person. Traveling to school involved getting ready, taking public transport like buses or bikes, and enjoying fresh air and a morning walk. Since students wake up just minutes before their online classes, they often skip breakfast. This leads to a lack of energy and potentially affects their ability to remember what they learn. During remote classes, students stay at home and learn via computers. This makes us less social and our daily lives less efficient. This is one reason why many experienced depression during the pandemic. Active individuals felt they couldn't do much with their lives, leading to severe situations like depression and, in some cases, suicide. On the other hand, technology has also positively changed societal values. When the coronavirus started spreading, remote learning was a significant advantage for students, proving technology to be extremely useful and reducing infection rates.To explore more about the impact of technology on education, visit the <a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/online-learnings-impact-student-performance">Online learning impact student perfomance</a>.</p>
