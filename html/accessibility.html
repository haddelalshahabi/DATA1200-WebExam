                <p>Welcome to our page dedicated to accessibility. At OsloMet, we understand the importance of creating a website that is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or the use of assistive technology. Accessibility means designing our digital resources so that they can be used by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities affecting their vision, hearing, motor skills, or cognitive abilities.</p>

                        <p> The initial test results showed 1 error, 7 alerts, 11 structural elements, and 2 ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes identified in the code. The error detected was related to a missing form label, which could impact the user's ability to understand the purpose of an input field, particularly for screen reader users.</p>

The number of alerts and structural elements remained unchanged, but the number of features increased from 7 to 8, suggesting an improvement in the website's accessibility or functionality. The original issue with the form label appears to have been addressed. Manual testing is still recommended to ensure compliance and optimal accessibility.</p>
